# Health X
## Better interfacing with HealthKit

HealthKit is notoriously hard to work with. 

Let's change that.


Using Combine features like `ObservableObject` and Swift 5.5 ones like asyncronous functions, we can make Apple health data accessible and easy to use.

## Installation
Health X can be installed with the [Swift Package Manager][1]. If you can't find it, search for it using our repository URL, https://github.com/Sid-MB/Health-X.
